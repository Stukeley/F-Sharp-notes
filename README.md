# F-Sharp-notes
F# beginner's notes.

A little bit of info about:

- variables
- functions
- data structures
- classes

## Why F# over C#?

1. Cleaner syntax for Math operations and data manipulation
2. Better performance for Math operations
3. Units of Measure (scientific applications)
4. Much more intuitive asynchronous programming, simple execution of code in Parallel
5. F# and C# code can be written and called from within the same solution
